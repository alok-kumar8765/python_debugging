        "While debugging, using print() statements to understand the flow of the pipeline and spot unexpected behavior is undoubtedly the most widely adopted approach.\n",

        "However, using print() has numerous caveats, such as:\n",
        "\n",
        "Print statements are usually intended to display an output to the user. If the programmer uses print() to debug, after debugging is over, the programmer should be cautious of removing only those specific print() statements that were intended for debugging.\n",
        "Often, during debugging, you may print multiple variables one after the other. In such cases, the programmer has to manually format the output to enhance its readability.\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "1.   Sometimes, the programmer might also be interested in printing the line number, the name of the function and its input, etc., which adds to the complexity of writing long/many print() statements.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.   In most situations, the codebase is not restricted to just one file. Instead, there are multiple files that form the pipeline. In such cases, one may be interested in displaying the name of the file as well during debugging, which can be a hassle with print().\n",
